# ðŸŒ± Crop Recommendation System: A Machine Learning Approach

In today's world, **sustainable agriculture** is a critical concern. To optimize crop yields and resource utilization, farmers need accurate and timely information to make informed decisions. This project aims to develop a **crop recommendation system** that leverages machine learning techniques to predict suitable crops based on soil and climatic conditions.
